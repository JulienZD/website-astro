    My name is Julien Zapata Duque. I am a {AGE}-year-old software developer
    from The Netherlands.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    I've had an interest in computers since I was 17. I built my first computer
    around my 18th birthday. Soon after that I was introduced to AutoHotkey, a
    scripting language to automate various aspects of Windows. I quickly picked
    up the basics and wrote some simple scripts. A few months later I started
    learning Python, but soon stopped because I couldn't find a real use for it
    in my daily life.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    A year or two went by without much change, until one day, when I was working
    at a local computer repair shop, where I was introduced to web development.
    They had recently hired someone to rebuild their website from the ground up
    and I was asked if I wanted to look over his shoulder as he worked. While I
    couldn't understand much of the code, I enjoyed the process around web
    development. So much that I started learning it in my free time with the
    help of online courses.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    At the age of 21 I decided to go to college to study Software Engineering.
    It was there where my love for software development has really made its
    home. After a{' '}
    <a href="/projects/neighborhood">full-stack web development project</a>
    I quickly fell in love with everything surrounding it. Since then I've spent
    my spare time learning TypeScript, and various fullstack technologies, such as
    Next.js and SvelteKit.
  </p>
  <p>I graduated on {graduationDate} ðŸŽ‰</p>
  <p>Other technolies I've worked with:</p>
  <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
    <li>TypeScript</li>
    <li>C# and .NET</li>
    <li>React and Next.js</li>
    <li>Svelte and SvelteKit</li>
    <li>PHP and Laravel</li>
    <li>Angular</li>
    <li>Flutter</li>
    <li>React Native</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>Various ORMs, such as Prisma and Sequelize</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Currently I'm working full time as a software developer at <a

    >. In my spare time I like to work on side projects and experiment with new
    technologies.
